title: The final report aka what I have learned and what I'll still have to learn
---
1. I have learned much, but I'll have to learn much more. I think now I have the basics that I'll need, but I would not dare to say that I would be a specialist in any of the programs we used this semester.
2. Python is an interesting programming language, but I'll have to complete the tutorial again to better understand the whole material.
3. I think sometimes there was much theory and less practice, so it was for me more difficult to understand some of the concepts we learnt about this semester, and sometimes we had easy exercises and the assignment was rather difficult in comparison. I think I'd need to have a look again at the theoretical part in ease and do more practice to improve.
4. After completing this course now I have the feeling that most of the assignments were not really extremely difficult, but they were time-consuming and sometimes annoying, especially when I consumed many hours in one thing and then I realized how easy the answer was, I just had to look at things differently.
5. Georeferencing and XML are really cool, I'll need to spend more time learning about them and using them. I think they are really useful for historians, I'm glad I'm now able to use these technologies!
6. Regular expression is interesting, but I have the feeling that it has a great potential that I'm not even fully aware of yet.
7. I think there is also much potential in topic modeling, I'm interested in seeing how it works with topics I usually work on, I'd be interested to see how it could contribute to my studies and future research.
8. I'm somewhat wary of social network analysis, I'm rather cautious when it comes to trends and hypes, and I think SNA has also become something similar. I'm not saying it's not useful, but it might not be as useful as it's made out to be.
9. I have to admit that it was somewhat intimidating at the beginning that most things on the curriculum were completely unknown to me, or I only had a vague idea of what it could be. It was all the more frigthening than if someone, then those who were born in the "digital age" should be able to deal with digital humanities with ease, but I had to realize that playing computer games at an early age does not mean that we can use advanced softwares to conduct historical research. All in all I'm glad I was able to participate in the course, even though my progress was often slower than I'd hoped and I still have much to learn!
