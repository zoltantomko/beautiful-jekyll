Since we got a solution for this homework, it was of course easier to understand what should be done to create a clean version of our xml files. I have to admit that I was pleasently surprised to see how useful xml files are. Even though the first thing we heard about xml was that it's about data and not about how data is visualized, but you actually have both. You don't really have to convert xml files or create clean versions of them, really, you can simply use Word to open them and see a normal readable version of your files, or if you're more interested in certain details that can only an xml file show, you can use EditPad for example. I think it's really a great advantage of xml that you have a file that can show you what you want to see both in terms of a normal readable text and as a format that contains additional information that can be used to your advantage if you're looking for specific informations that can be extracted from this format.
