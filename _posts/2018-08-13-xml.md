Since we got a solution for this homework, it was of course easier to understand what should be done to create a clean version of our xml files. I have to admit that I was pleasently surprised to see how useful xml files are. Even though the first thing we heard about xml was that it's about data and not about how data is visualized, but you actually have both. You don't really have to convert xml files or create clean versions of them, really, you can simply use Word to open them and see a normal readable version of your files, or if you're more interested in certain details that can only an xml file show, you can use EditPad for example. I think it's really a great advantage of xml that you have a file that can show you what you want to see both in terms of a normal readable text and as a format that contains additional information that can be used to your advantage if you're looking for specific informations that can be extracted from this format. Using xml is all the more useful for me, as I often need to use texts from the website of the Perseus Project that we also used in this class. I often need to use reliable editions that I can also copy into other formats so that I can work with them, but copy and paste from the website was never particularly funny, especially seeing that you can always see only a small portion of the whole text. Now that I realized that I can simply download the complete text in xml format, open it in Word and copy what I need is really something that'll come in handy in the future!
