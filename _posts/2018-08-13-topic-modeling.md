We got the entire script for this exercise, and I'm glad we did because I'm not sure I would have managed to write it on my own. However, the script worked wonderfully, and I got my results. The code was fortunately also very clear and easy to understand (although probably, just as I said, it would have been difficult to write it without help), so it was not difficult to change the topics from 40 to 30. I consulted Rob Nelson's website as you requested, but his results were somewhat overwhelming, honestly, I'd need much more time to digest so much information at once. I also have to say that I'll need much time to see what I can do with R, I think I have still much to discover. Interestingly, a few months ago I talked to a friend who's a programmer, and when I told him we'd cover R in our DH course he was quite surprised, as apparently R has a reputation even amongst programmers as a rather difficult programming language. I'm glad we did cover it in class, but I can understand now why this friend of mine said it was maybe easier for us beginners to try to learn other programming languages at the beginning, it does seem to be a rather complicated programming language.
