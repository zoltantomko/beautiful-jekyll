This time we were provided again with the solution of the homework which made our assignment much easier of course. Again, I cannot help but wander how useful xml files are. The QGIS part was not particularly difficult, but I still need to practice more and see which other functions there are that I could use, as I have the feeling that we only scratched the surface with QGIS.
